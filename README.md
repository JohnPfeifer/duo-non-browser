# duo-non-browser
Non-browser support for Duo authentication for the Shibboleth IdP.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/JohnPfeifer/duo-non-browser/wiki) for notes on how to configure Shibboleth to make use of these classes.

## DISCLAIMERS:

1) this is intended as a stop-gap until such time as Shibboleth provides this functionality “out of the box”
   !!! Shib IdP 3.4 natively supports this fuctionality (which whould be used in preference to this code).

2) this has not been rigorously tested so don’t go blindly dropping this into your production environments (not that anyone would)

3) strictly AS iS; I cannot promise any further development on it since it took rather more time than I expected

4) built against IdP v3.3.1
