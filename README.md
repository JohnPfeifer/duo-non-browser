# duo-non-browser
Duo non-browser authentication for Shibboleth IdP.  Built against v3.3.1.

## While this code is more than just a proof-of-concept, it should not be considered production ready without rigorous testing.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/JohnPfeifer/duo-non-browser/wiki) for notes on how to configure Shibboleth to make use of these classes.
